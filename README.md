## About

This repository provides a simple starting point for React developers using Vite. It includes basic configuration for React, Vite, and ESLint, with minimal setup to get you up and running quickly. It allows developers to focus on the logic of their applications without worrying about boilerplate setup.

## Features

- **React**: A minimal setup to get React working with Vite.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a smooth development experience with HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
- **ESLint**: Integrated ESLint for JavaScript linting and code quality checks.
- **React Fast Refresh**: Uses Vite's plugin system for fast refresh in development mode.
- **Optimized for Production**: The configuration allows easy expansion for production applications, including support for TypeScript.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to get started with the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yash1144/API-Hunter.git
   cd API-Hunter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Vite development server and open the app in your default web browser.

## Usage

After installing dependencies and running the development server, you can start developing your application. Any changes made to the source code will be reflected in real-time thanks to Vite's hot module replacement feature.

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready app will be generated in the `dist/` folder.

## Configuration

This repository provides a minimal React and Vite setup. Here are the basic configurations used:

- **React**: Uses the official Vite plugin `@vitejs/plugin-react` for React support.
- **Vite**: Vite is configured with a fast development experience, bundling optimizations, and a smooth production build process.

You can customize the Vite and React configurations as per your project needs.

## ESLint Configuration

ESLint has been integrated to help maintain code quality. By default, it uses standard ESLint rules. If you're building a production application, it's recommended to enable TypeScript and integrate the `typescript-eslint` plugin.

Here is the basic ESLint configuration for this repository:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:react/recommended"
  ],
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "node": true,
    "es6": true
  },
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 12,
    "sourceType": "module",
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    }
  },
  "plugins": ["react"],
  "rules": {
    "react/prop-types": "off",
    "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off"
  }
}
```
